I want the ability to input certain pieces of information and have it create 36 month projections. The input data will include the following . . .

MSRP

From that inputted MSRP, calculate the following prices . . .

DTC adjusted: (DTC – 5%)

WSP: (50% of DTC) – set these up as percentages that can be modified

Amazon: (59% of DTC)

Emerson/Fullscript: (75% of DTC)

iHerb adjusted: (55% of DTC – 5%))

Domestic Wholesaler: (50% of DTC)

Domestic Distributor: (50% of DTC)

Domestic eTailor: (50% of DTC)

International Wholesaler: (50% of DTC)

International Distributor: (50% of DTC)

International eTailer: (50% of DTC)

 

Average Sales Price will then be calculated from the average of all prices listed in the pricing section above minus the WSP price and the DTC price but do include the DTC adjusted price.

 

The next input data will be quantity as follows . . .

 

Quantity for year 1

Quantity for year 2

Quantity for year 3

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The next input and output will be . . .

Input %

Input %

 

Then next to each of those % input options, calculate the corresponding COGS by multiplying the Average Sales Price by each corresponding % Gross Margin.

 

The next input will be for Testing. Create four columns and six rows that look like this . . .

Then create these results using the above data . . .

 

Full Panel Testing/Bottle Annual

Take the “calculate from above rows” answer above and divide by quantity for year 1

Stability Testing Amortized 3 Years

Take the Stability input data above and divide by the sum of quantity from year 1 plus quantity from year 2 plus quantity from year 3

 

The next input will be for Targeted Formula Cost. List three options for Gross Margin for Targeted Formula Cost that will be in percentages . . .

 

Input %

Input %

Input %

 

Then next to each of those % input options, calculate the corresponding Targeted Formula Cost by multiplying the Average Sales Price by each corresponding % Gross Margin input here and then minus the sum of Full Panel Testing/Bottle Annual results above and the Stability Testing Amortized 3 Years above but divide the sum of these two by 1.03.

 

The next input will be . . .

 

Preliminary P&L

Formula + Freight

input
